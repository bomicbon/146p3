Analysis of Experiment 1 - Tree Sizes

         We tested each tree size for 100 rounds.
         Tree sizes were tested as follows: (200 (nodes), 300, 400, 500, 600)
         Generally, the more nodes a tree has, the higher chance it has of winning.
         When a tree has more nodes, it has explored more possibilities.
         Therefore, it can find better paths to reach better end results.
         Based on our graph, the largest difference between the wins and losses
         occured at round 3 - when red had 400 nodes.
         After this point, when red was tested with more nodes, it seems that
         the benefits begin to diminish.
         We see the result of this diminishing at round 5, where the win/loss
         difference is not as striking.
