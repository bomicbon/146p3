Analysis of Experiment 2 - Heuristic Improvement

         1. Does the modified version win more games?
            The modified version does indeed win more games.   
         2. Does this change if you increase / decrease the size of the tree?
            This does change if we increase / decrease the size of the tree.
            Increasing the size of the tree namely increases its opportunity
            of finding better paths to a point. Decreasing the size of the
            tree decreases its chance of winning. After a certain number
            of increases however, the improvements do begin to diminish.

            1000 nodes takes a long time to run even 1 round,
            but based on the results we're getting, it seems that
            the modified heuristic is beating the vanilla version.
